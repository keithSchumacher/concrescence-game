# Concrescence - Design Notes

## Game Design Ideas

### Core Mechanics
- Graph-based gameplay with nodes and connections
- Territory control through strategic node acquisition
- Modular ruleset engine for customizable gameplay
- Abstract visualization that focuses on connectivity rather than geography

### Rule Engine Concepts
- Node ownership rules (capture, control, influence)
- Movement/expansion rules (adjacent spread, node jumping, etc.)
- Combat/conflict resolution (deterministic vs probabilistic)
- Resource management (if applicable)
- Victory conditions (total control, strategic positions, score-based)

### Visualization Ideas
- Abstract node representation (circles, polygons)
- Edge visualization (lines, paths, borders)
- Color coding for player ownership
- Animation for state changes and actions
- Zoom and pan controls for large graphs

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Prototype
- [ ] Display and interact with a static graph
- [ ] Simple node selection and ownership changes
- [ ] Hardcoded ruleset for testing
- [ ] Basic UI for game state and actions

### Phase 2: Core Engine
- [ ] Implement flexible graph data structure
- [ ] Build modular rule system
- [ ] Add turn-based gameplay loop
- [ ] Save/load game state

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Custom graph editor/loader
- [ ] Rule configuration interface
- [ ] Visual enhancements and effects
- [ ] Audio design and implementation

### Phase 4: Multiplayer
- [ ] Network architecture planning
- [ ] Server-client communication
- [ ] Lobby and game session management
- [ ] Synchronization and validation

## Technical Decisions

### Language and Tools
- GDScript for rapid prototyping and UI
- C++ via GDExtension for performance-critical algorithms
- JSON or custom format for ruleset configuration

### Data Structures
- Graph representation: adjacency list or matrix
- Game state serialization format
- Rule configuration schema
